This very simple demo app provides a form which takes user input and writes that input to a table in Snowflake. In this case we are using an employee satisfaction survey as an example.

After the user input has been submitted, the app pulls the average of each numeric response category from the Snowflake database, including the following:
<br><br>
• Satisfaction with work-life balance (on a scale of 1 to 10)<br>
• Satisfaction with company culture (on a scale of 1 to 10)<br>
• Satisfaction with manager (on a scale of 1 to 10)<br>
• Satisfactionw ith events (on a scale of 1 to 10)<br>
• Satisfaction with office (on a scale of 1 to 10)
